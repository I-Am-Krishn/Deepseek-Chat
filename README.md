# Deepseek Chat

Deepseek Chat is a modern, fast, and fully client-side AI chat interface inspired by ChatGPT and Gemini UI patterns.  
It supports ultra-long conversation memory (up to 100,000 messages per session), automatic Markdown formatting,  
colorful code blocks, message tools, and a real-time branch diagram that visualizes your entire conversation structure.

The app runs entirely in the browser and communicates directly with Deepseek models through the Puter AI SDK.  
No backend, no server hosting, no database — everything is local, secure, and fast.
